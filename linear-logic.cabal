description:
    This package provides a library for reasoning
    with linear logic on top of linear haskell.
    .
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07518.pdf Linear Logic for Constructive Mathematics>
    by Michael Shulman provides a principled take on this topic. There he constructs
    an embedding of an affine logic into an intuitionistic logic via a Chu construction.
    .
    However, that version of things was only able to express an 'affine logic' where
    the pairs \(\top\) and @()@, \(\bot\) and @Void@ are made to coincide.
    .
    Reconstructing this technique on top of <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756 Linear Haskell>
    allows us to construct a full intuitionistic linear logic, while retaining Shulman's
    style of refutation.
    .

    | Disjunction            | 'Either' w/ unit 'Void'  | @('â…‹')@ w/ unit 'Bot' |
    +------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
    .
    'Either' (or @('+')@) takes the place of the traditional \(\oplus\)
    .
    '(,)' (or @('*')@) takes the place of the traditional \(\otimes\)
    .
    To use the alias for @('*')@, make sure to enable @{-# LANGUAGE NoStarIsType #-}@
    .
    Negative polarity connectives are 'GHC.Types.RuntimeRep' polymorphic,
    but only currently have 'Prop' instances defined for ''LiftedRep'
